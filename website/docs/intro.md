# Coast Train: Building a Massive Library of Labeled Coastal Images to Train Machine Learning for Coastal Hazards and Resources

Scientists who study coastal ecosystems and hazards such as hurricanes, flooding, and cliff failure collect lots of photographs of coastal environments from airplanes and drones. A large area can be surveyed at high resolution and low cost. Additionally, satellites such as Landsat have provided imagery of the Nation’s coastlines every few days for decades. Scientist’s ability to understand coastal hazards would be greatly improved if this wealth of imagery could be ‘mined’ automatically by computers. We want to automate the process of identifying and labelling each region of the image from a set of categories (e.g. bare land, water, woody vegetation, herbaceous vegetation). We need to train a computer to recognize the same things that a human can and that will require a very large number of labeled images.

## Why do we need Coast Train?

Coast Train will provide researchers working in coastal environments (including but not limited to deltas, estuaries, barrier islands, salt marshes, developed and undeveloped coastlines including low energy and high energy coastal environments) with a training set that heretofore has been missing, allowing them to overcome a significant challenge to applying supervised and semi-supervised ML algorithms to the segmentation of high- and medium-resolution imagery. The library will allow us to train generic image segmentation models for satellite and high-resolution orthomosaics that will classify imagery into feature classes commonly used to categorize Earth surface composition (for example, water bodies, substrates, surficial geology, vegetation types, coastal infrastructure, development, and other landcover classes).

We anticipate that the datasets will be used by numerous groups both nationally and internationally to help train models for image segmentation of coastal and other natural environments. This labeled image library can be used either in their intended environments (i.e., the coastal waters of the conterminous United States) or used to train models that serve as starting points for training models for similar environments (e.g., other coastal regions, rivers, mountains, and lakes) with less data than would otherwise be needed — a concept known in ML as Transfer Learning. Therefore, the likely positive impact of the Coast Train dataset would extend beyond both coasts, the USGS, and the United States.

## The Coast Train team

We are scientists working in coastal environments on topics in coastal conservation and ecology, hazards, mapping, physical oceanography, geography, and coastal geomorphology, with practical and research experience in image labeling, ML, and scientific applications.
